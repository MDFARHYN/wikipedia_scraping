## Overview

In this project, we are going to build a **Wikipedia Scraping Tool**. This tool will allow you to automatically collect data from Wikipedia pages, such as infoboxes, tables, and plain text. You will learn how to clean, store, and visualize this data using Python libraries like **BeautifulSoup**, **Pandas**, and **Matplotlib**. We'll even go as far as storing the data in a **custom SQLite database**!

Along the way, we'll cover topics like error handling, the importance of using proxies to avoid being blocked, and how to scrape ethically.

Whether you're curious about web scraping, need data for a project, or want to enhance your Python skills, this guide will walk you through the process step-by-step.
